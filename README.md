# SmartHome-AirQuality
 The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 3 million people 
died from indoor air pollution. Various homes are affected by issues related to air pollution. 
These originate mostly from daily home activities such as cooking, cleaning chemicals, heating,  
respiration, and inadequate access to fresh air circulation in the house. Therefore, the air in the 
home contains various pollutants like dust, particulate matter, Carbon Dioxide, and volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), among others. As an effect, people are more exposed to 
respiratory health risks like Hyperventilation, Dyspnea, Bradypnea, Tachypnea, and  
Hypoventilation since the pollutants in the air are invisible with a naked eye and therefore, itâ€™s 
almost impossible to tell whether the air they are breathing has been polluted or not, which is 
why our Home  Air Quality Controller will be there to detect the levels of  those pollutants in the 
air and automatically take action like adjusting  the ventilation system or activating  air filtration, 
based on those readings to maintain optimal indoor air quality. 
 
Proposed Solution:  Our Home Air Quality Controller will use sensors which will be enabled at 
all  times and continuously detecting air quality in the home as well as collecting data on 
pollutant levels. Whenever the pollutant level exceeds the set limit, the controller will 
automatically trigger actions like increasing ventilation which includes opening windows or 
adjusting the HVAC system to bring in more fresh air, activating the air purifier to increase 
filtration and minimize particulate pollutants. It will also alert the home users by sending 
notification to a smart phone app about the poor air quality in the house. Briefly, our system will 
automatically monitor, analyse and take action on air quality to insure a healthy environment in 
the house.
